# Sample React Site for demo

This project was created using `create-react-app`. The purpose is for homepage demo.

This version is currently only not responsive, the design is for desktop only. Only the links in the primary menu work.

### Potential Improvements

- Move React Router code block in side `App.js` into a different component file. Generate `Route` components using lists and keys instead.
- Work on router/navigation for blogs/posts
- Integrate Redux
- Hover animations for buttons/links.
- Responsive work
